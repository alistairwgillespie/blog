        "Let's start with one of the earliest forms of machine learning, the perceptron. It make's sense to start here given modern day neural networks evolved from this point. The perceptron was inspired by neurons in the brain; the idea being that a neuron's functionality is represented using a function that takes a set of inputs and generates an output. So how does it work? Let's visualise it first:\n",

Each input's weight is based on importance; the larger the weight, the greater the importance of the input. To represent this algebraically, we get the following:\n",

        "I think at this juncture we can cement this knowledge with an example. Let's use a perceptron as a decision making model for deciding whether we go watch the West Coast Eagles versus North Melbourne Kangaroos. Our model will take in three binary inputs:\n",
        "1. Is it raining or not?\n",

Lastly, I prefer to go to the important games against top 8 sides so we assign a weight of 2. We now have the following weights: $w_1=6, w_2=4, w_3=2$. For my decision threshold, I will assign a 5, in other words, if my model output is greater than 5 I will attend the footy.\n",

Let's go ahead and calculate the output:\n",

The model clearly appreciates sunny weather and the availability of company, if neither are true, it's likely this model will suggest I stay home. I'm a little more passionate about the Eagles than this example let's on but you get the gist. It's important to note that by changing the weights and threshold, we will get different models of decision making. \n",

The subsequent layer then takes those outputs as inputs to determine a final decision. We can think of the first layer as making a set of simple decisions, which then allows the next layer to conduct more subtle or complex decisions. This layered approach can be extended both by the number of layers and nodes to achieve complex and sophisticated decision making models."
